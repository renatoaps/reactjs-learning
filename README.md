# Learning React

you can run a first project using NPX (recommended):

`npx create-react-app your-app`

The `index.js` is responsible to render your `App`, by reading the `root element`in your `index.html` file.

##### So, what happens?
#

the `ReactDOM.render` initialize first, then apply to the DOM , inside the root element your `App.js`.
changing dinamically the DOM for your page.
